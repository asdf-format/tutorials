    "Writing your second ASDF converter tutorial\n",
    "===================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended to include the use of ASDF schemas\n",
    "for the purposes of validating the ASDF files generated and\n",
    "read by this converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are ASDF schemas for?\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it represents a different level of sophistication and\n",
    "consequently, more work. But it has the benefit of ensuring that\n",
    "the files it tries to read are legal against the expectations\n",
    "of the converter. For example, if someone hand edited an ASDF\n",
    "file where elements of the file include your serialized object,\n",
    "and they modify that object in such a way as to invalidate the\n",
    "object, the schema mechanism provides a way of checking that\n",
    "they haven't broken it. This makes it simple to help ensure that\n",
    "a file that is causing problems isn't with the file itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "An aside: the schema helps eliminate many problems, but not all\n",
    "necessarily. For example if one of the attributes of your object\n",
    "requires that it be a prime number, there is no schema mechanism\n",
    "to ensure it is a prime number, but it can ensure that the file\n",
    "has the required attributes, that they are of the right type,\n",
    "and can place some constraints on their values (e.g., min and \n",
    "max values, or that strings match some regular expression, or \n",
    "are one of an enumerated set of permitted values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of this tutorial\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To write converters that use schemas, and to ensure that they\n",
    "be language independent (i.e., don't require installing Python)\n",
    "we will be building a framework to allow that (if you ever \n",
    "suspect that that the schemas will be used by other libraries\n",
    "that are not in Python). Doing so adds some added complexity,\n",
    "so this tutorial is aimed mostly at those that will be writing\n",
    "schemas for pipeline code that generate products that should\n",
    "not intrinsically require Python to read. (A separate tutorial\n",
    "may be written for cases where schemas are desired, but only \n",
    "for Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a bit of effort to understand how to write schemas. \n",
    "If they seem odd and a bit confusing, that is normal. They \n",
    "are their own language of a sort and it takes a little time\n",
    "to get used to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schemas also involve providing mechanisms to link the schemas\n",
    "to tags so that the library knows how to associate the the schemas\n",
    "and tags with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will be using schema manifests, which provide a\n",
    "more convenient way of handling multiple schemas and tags,\n",
    "and to illustrate, we will use two tags this time around.\n",
    " \n",
    "Groundwork\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires making two separate packages, one for\n",
    "the schemas, a separate one for the converters (again, so that\n",
    "the schemas are not tied directly to Python; but note there\n",
    "will be a small amount of code in the schema package for Python,\n",
    "and we expect that if other languages are used, code for those\n",
    "may appear there as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "A utility has been developed so that the schema package is \n",
    "fairly easily generated and this tutorial will use that utility.\n",
    "The structure of the converter package will be very similar to\n",
    "that of the first tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Software\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- asdf v2.8 or higher\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is recommended when creating your own package but \n",
    "not directly needed for this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "- cookiecutter (do a `pip install cookiecutter`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Software uninstall\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did the first tutorial (Your_first_ASDF_converter), in a terminal window \n",
    "type `pip uninstall mfconverter` since this tutorial will reuse the same \n",
    "photoID class and we don't want confusion between the two converters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create schema package\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "First ensure you are in the directory that you want to create both packages in, by default it will be your home directory below, but change it to what you want before executing."
