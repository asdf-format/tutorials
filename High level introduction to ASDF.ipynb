This notebook will only summarize these items briefly. This will also give a brief listing of some of the features of ASDF, particularly with regard to FITS. Finally we will list some of the tutorial resources available (as they become available)"

    "These are the reasons we developed ASDF instead of using FITS\n",
    "\n",
    "- 8 character limitation on keyword sizes\n",
    "- Keyword, value, comment restriction to 80 characters\n",
    "- Lack of any widely accepted mechanism for hierarchical organization of metadata or data\n",
    "- Poor support for widely used binary types (particularly unsigned 16 bit integers)\n",
    "- Lack of versioning of the standard\n",
    "- Lack of good validation tools\n",
    "- Allowance of many nonstandard FITS files that libraries must support\n",
    "- Lack of streaming support\n",
    "- Inflexible data models for cloud use\n",
    "- Very poor support for complex World Coordinate System transforms (a very large headache for HST data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The last item is a topic in its own right and probably the single biggest factor in developing ASDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other existing formats were looked at and all had serious flaws. (See xxx for more details)"

    "YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a standard text format that is easier to read than XML and more concise and readable than JSON. It is generally intended that the YAML header will hold all the metadata for the data contained within the file. It also is used to indicate the organization of all the data and how it is associated with relevant metadata."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "- No limit on the length of attribute names (analogous to FITS keyword names).\n",
    "- No limit on attribute values, which may theselves be complex values. This allows arbitrarily nested structures.\n",
    "- Ability to \"tag\" values as having a special type that software may know how to specially handle.\n",
    "- Ability to have different attributes reference the same data or object without making copies, so that data or object can be shared by many things.\n",
    "- Full support for all standard numerical binary values.\n",
    "- Supports mode of putting some or all data \"in-line\", i.e., as text values.\n",
    "- Supports very flexible WCS model.\n",
    "- Mechanism for extensions to the standard format, both in the standard itself, and for local purposes.\n",
    "- Versioned globally, and for specific extensions.\n",
    "- Support for schema files that can be used to validate the proper structure of the file, both for reading and writing.\n",
    "- Support for streamed data.\n",
    "- Language agnostic, but currently only fully supported in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these items value may not yet be obvious to the reader, but tutorials will illustrate  the value with examples."
