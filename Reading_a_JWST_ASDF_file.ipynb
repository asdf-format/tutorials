    "### Basic organization of ASDF files\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the basic organizational structures of an ASDF file will help in navigating the contents of such files. In brief, the organization consists of an arbitrary nesting of the equivalent of Python lists and dictionaries. As a result, getting to any particular item involves either indexing by number when a list is encountered (YAML parlance is an \"array\") or by a key when a dictionary is encountered (YAML parlance is \"map\"). Furthermore, if any item is preceded by a YAML \"tag\", Python generally knows (if the appropriate software is installed) how to turn it into a corresponding Python object. The most common instance of this case is for ndarray or table data. If a tag for a ndarray is encountered, Python will turn this into a numpy array automatically (though perhaps not until you wish to access the array). But many other kinds of tags and corresponding Python objects will be encountered.\n",

    "### Reading a JWST ASDF file\n",
    "\n",
    "Unbeknownst to many, while the JWST pipeline normally works with FITS files, it has been designed to work with ASDF files as well (though there is currently a small change needed to enable this). Turning JWST data products into ASDF files is easy, and our first example will be with such a file. First some preliminaries such as doing the needed imports and references to the data files used for this tutorial (they must be downloaded, but this notebook handles that)."

First thing to know is that when you open ASDF files, images are not loaded into memory when it is opened, but information about that image (or array) is. When you actually access the data itself, it will be loaded. We will do that now"

    "The short answer is that there are not any in the file. We will be working on tools to extract the equivalent information from the associated schemas that define what attributes and values are expected in a JWST file, but there isn't one yet. Generally speaking one can look at the corresponding schema to find out definitions and units for values, but that won't be covered in this tutorial. For Roman we expect to use quantities for many values, which have explicit units. But JWST had to mirror the values in FITS keyword/value cards so quantities are not generally used."

    "### About ASDF Terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of an ASDF file is essentially a tree. Each node may take on one of four general characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It may be a simple value, e.g., a string, number, or boolean value.\n",
    "2. It may be a list of values, in which case each of these values is indexed by number\n",
    "3. It may be a dictionary of values, in which case each of these values is indexed by the dictionary key.\n",
    "4. A reference to a value elsewhere in the file, either a simple value, list, or dict\n",
    "\n",
    "So branching at nodes is either done by lists or dictionaries. Simple values are endpoints of a branch. When tags are used, a whole subtree may be turned into a corresponding Python object, which in Python is the endpoint of a branch. To illustrate, in the YAML header, an array is characterized by the number of items that defined the array and where the data are located. But when reading this YAML header into Python, all that information is used to create a numpy array and information about that array is now embedded in the numpy array itself (e.g., its shape, type and other attributes). A \"path\" to a node is essentially the sequence of indices needed to locate it. In the case above, the science data is only one level down, and its path is ['data']. In the original YAML header, there would be deeper levels, but they have all been used to create the numpy array. Much of the metadata for this data set is in the attribute labeled 'meta'"
