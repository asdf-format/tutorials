    "## Relevance to ASDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, GWCS has some extra features. But why is this part of an ASDF tutorial? Mainly to illustrate that ASDF preserves all the intrinsic information about the WCS and does not restrict transforms to a finite set of tools as FITS WCS does. We will illustrate this by examining this WCS in more detail. First note that ASDF allows an arbitrary number of intermediate frames (especially useful for spectral data), as well as an arbitrary number of different WCS models within a file. ASDF provides a way of saving most of astropy's models, of which there is a large number. More important, it can save astropy compound models. Arbitrarily complex combinations of models can be used and saved in ASDF, including all the projection models that FITS provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while most of this tutorial is focused on GWCS, it is ASDF that enables this to be used with data files without forcing the user to obtain reference files and special software to determine the correct WCS as had to be done during most of HST lifetime.\n",

    "This compound model is sufficiently complicated to require some detailed explanation (but not nearly as complicated as some JWST spectral WCS models!). First a brief explanation of the notation. Inputs and outputs indicate that this model takes two input values (or two arrays of values and generates two output values, i.e., two input coordinates and two output coordinates. Expression is the expression used to combine astropy models into a more complex compound model. To keep the expression concise, each term is replaced by a number and the model associated with that number is listed below. The two operators in particular that need special explanation are & and |. The & operator means that two functions are joined by adding dimensionality. If a Shift function shifts the value of the input by the given value, the joining two Shift functions shift the first input by the first value, and the second input by the second value. It is a way of making two 1D functions a 2D function, albeit with each input coordinate treated independently of the other. The | operator feeds the output of the preceding function into the next. The number of outputs of the preceding function must match the number of inputs of the following function. Finally, the Mapping function acts as a switchboard between inputs and output. For example, Mapping(0, 1, 0, 1) takes two inputs and generates 4 outputs, where outputs 0 and 2 are both equal to the first input, and outputs 1 and 3 are both equal to the second input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to summarize in words what this transform does: shifts both input values first by 1 and then by -1024.5. This to make the coordinates relative to the center of the detector and center of that pixel. The next step splits the two input values so that both go to two different 2D polynomials (each of which produces only one value, so the net result is two output values. Then these values go through a similar split and to a second polynomial that is effectively applying a small rotation, followed by a shift in the V2,V3 coordinate system.\n",

    "## Modifying the WCS\n",

    "This is a somewhat contrived example, but it is to illustrate that one can make customizations to a WCS fairly easily. In this particular case one could change any of the parameters in the transforms and save the new WCS to an ASDF file without any concern for how to do that. Or one can modify the existing transform by adding new elements to the transform. So supposing the existing plate scale used does not include velocity aberration, then one would want to include that as well as a plate scale change, and perhaps not change  the existing plate scale application to be clear there are two different scales applied. \n",
