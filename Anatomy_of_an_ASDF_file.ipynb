    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended for those that are interested in some of the details of what is actually within an ASDF file and how the information is stored. This tutorial is not a full description, but should be treated as a basic introduction. There are more advanced aspects that will be addressed in other tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contrasting with FITS\n",
    "\n",
    "As a refresher, FITS files consist of a list of one or more HDU units (Header Data Units). Each header consists of a multiple of 36 80 byte ASCII records (i.e., each header has a size that must be a multiple of 2880 bytes). Most of these 80 byte records (a remnant of the old punched cards size) consist of a keyword and a value, with an optional comment. Keywords are limited to 8 characters, the values may have type Boolean, integer, float or string and may be as long as as there are spaces left on the record. Comments can take up the remaining unused character spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data unit must also be of a size that is a multiple of 2880 bytes but the data itself doesn't have to be that size. Data may be an array, table, ascii table and some other more specialized types for special fields (e.g., Radio Astronomy). What type it is and the type of the numbers and elements contained within are specified in the associated header.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASDF structure\n",
    "\n",
    "ASDF files have only one header, which is pure YAML (Yaml Ain't Markup Language) followed by 0 or more binary blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yaml is a descriptive text format meant to be reasonably readable by people (as opposed to, say, XML). JSON, a common web interchange format is a subset of YAML. YAML is capable of representing complex organization of information by the means of two basic structures (Python terminology will be used here although this will mention the corresponding YAML terms once), these being dictionaries (maps in YAML) and lists (arrays in YAML). YAML is a bit schizophenic in that it has two different syntaxes for representing such structure; one is Python like and uses indentation, the other is more C like and uses grouping delimiters such as `{` an `}`. Both can be used within the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of YAML over FITS headers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- equivalent of keywords can be very long (between 128 and 1024 characters depending on the library)\n",
    "- values lengths are not restricted, and are not restricted to be simple values, values may be dictionaries or lists\n",
    "- tag feature allows libraries to handle specific contents in a custom way (more later)\n",
    "- references\n",
    "- and that implicit grouping is implied by the use of dictionaries and lists, something FITS has no equivalent mechanism other then defining special conventions for specific data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASDF standard adds specific extra features to YAML capabilities and the ability to include binary data  that will be summarized later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "First an example without binary data, viewed as a simple text file"
